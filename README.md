Project 1: Fork Off
Team: Annie Ngo, Barbara Wright, Colin Grant, Kyle Bauer, Richard Clark
This is an app that allows users to create a "room" and allow other users to join the private room with an "access key". 
Once all users are in the room, the users are able to decide on where to eat by either clicking "thumbs up" to agree or "thumbs down" to see other restaurant options. When all parties agree, then the final selection will appear on all screens.

Burgers
